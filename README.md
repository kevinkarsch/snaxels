This repo contains code (and binaries, apparently) corresponding to the NPAR'11 paper:

K. Karsch, J. Hart. "Snaxels on a Plane." NPAR, 2011.

_Disclaimer: This code hasn't been touched (or compiled) since 2011, and certainly contains a lot of embarrassing code. Use/attempt to compile at your own risk._
